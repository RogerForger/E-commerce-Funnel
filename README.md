Key Metrics

 # Conversion rate per funnel stage

Findings

 # Sudden drop of conversion on the stage of “adding payment info”

Interpretation

 # High checkout abandonment suggests friction during payment or shipping selection rather than issues with product discovery or cart engagement.
 
Recommendations
